# TryHackMe Basic Pentesting
**This is a machine that allows you to practise web app hacking and privilege escalation**

## Task-1 Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation

1. Deploy the machine and connect to our network <br>
Answer : Read and submit

2. Find the services exposed by the machine<br> 
Answer : Read and submit

3. What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)? <br>
Answer : development

4. User brute-forcing to find the username & password <br>
Answer : Read and submit

* From the development directory we see two files('dev.txt', and 'j.txt'). After opening them we can get an idea that the server is running on samba and we can try to login as anonymous. Type command (*smbclient //IP/anonymous*) and type password as (*anonymous*). Yes, we are logged in. Type (*ls*) to see content of smbclient. We see a (*staff.txt*) file . Type (*get staff.txt*) and exit the smb connection . Then see content of staff.txt on your working directory. You will see two usernames which are answers to some below questions*

5. What is the username? <br>
Answer : jan

6.  What is the password?<br>
Answer : armando (* Use hydra to crack password using command (*hydra -l jan -P rockyou.txt <IP>*) * )

7. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?<br>
Answer :  SSH

8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation<br> 
Answer : Read and  submit

9. What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?<br> 
Answer : kay (*from above reference*)

10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information? <br>
Answer : Read and submit

* After getting the password for jan we will login as ssh using commad (*ssh jan@<IP>*) and type its password. Inside the shell in jan directory we didn't see any useful information. So we try to go to kay folder using command (*cd /home/kay*). Type (*ls -la*) to see its content. We see many hidden directories and one in particular called '.ssh' . We will (*cd*) into it and we see a rsa key named 'id_rsa'. Copy the content of this file in your local terminal as we will try to crack it thru john. Now locate the file 'ssh2john.py' in your terminal and type the command (*python ssh2john.py filename_of_rsa_key > new_filename.hash*) . This will convert the rsa file to hash format for john to crack.To crack the password type the command (*john new_filename.hash -wordlist=rockyou.txt*) . You will get the password (bee****) . We can try to login into kay using this password from the user jan itself using following command (*ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa kay@IP*) and type in the password. After that we will see that we have read access to 'pass.bak' file. After seeing its content we will have our final password. *

11. What is the final password you obtain?<br> 	
Answer : here***************************************************$$

## Bonus task

1. There is a flag.txt file in root user . Just type command (*sudo su*) and password for kay to gain root access. After that just see content of flag.txt.
