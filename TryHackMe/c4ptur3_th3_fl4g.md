Answer : Let's make this a bit trickier (*this is a combination of above mentioned questions*)

## Task-2 Hashes

* All the below hashes can be cracked on https://md5hashing.net/

1. 39d4a2ba07e44421c9bedd54dc4e1182<br>
Answer : MDwhat?

2. e0418e7c6c2f630c71b2acabbcf8a2fb<br>
Answer : digest the messahe algorithm

3. efbd448a935421a54dda43da43a701e1<br>
Answer : 128-bit of delicious hash values

4. 11FE61CE0639AC2A1E815D62D7DEEC53<br>
Answer : Microsoft has encryption? (*clearly had to look up to its solution as i couldn't find any method to crack this hash*)

5. a361f05487b879f25cc4d7d7fae3c7442e7849ed15c94010b389faafaf8763f0dd022e52364027283d55dcb10974b09e7937f901584c092da65a14d1aa8dc4d8<br>
Answer : 1024 bit blocks!

5. d48a2f790f7294a4ecbac10b99a1a4271cdc67fff7246a314297f2bca2aaa71f<br>
Answer : Commonly used in Blockchain

6. a34e50c78f67d3ec5d0479cde1406c6f82ff6cd0<br>
Answer : The OG

## Task-3 Spectrograms

1. Download the file <br>
Answer : Super Secret Message (*use audacity or sonic visualizer and select spectrogram option*)

## Task-4 Steganography

1. Decode the image to reveal the answer.<br>
Answer : SpaghettiSteg (*Can be decoded using steghide . Type 'steghide --extract -sf file_name'*)

## Task-5 Security through obscurity

1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?<br>
Answer : hackerchat.png

2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.<br>
Answer : "AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!"

* For these you can get the answer by just opening the file in any text editor and you will see your answer in the end.

* But here is the method to do it systematically. First type (*binwalk file_name*) to see for hidden files. If found something type (*binwalk -e filename*). From this you will have answer to your first question. Also there is another file with extension 'zlib'. Just type (*strings file_name*) and scroll down at the bottom end. Here you will get answer to your first question.
